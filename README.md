## Overview
**SCANFI** aims to develop AI-based extensions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The project focuses on creating AI agents that simulate the functions of various PFC regions to assist in real-time cognitive tasks. The agents are built using Experts.js and other web technologies.

### Name Change Notification
We have rebranded from SCANJS to SCANUE due to SCANJS being a deprecated project created by another developer. If "SCANJS" appears in documentation, code, or other references, this was prior to the name change. **SCANFI** is a conversion from SCANUE to a Next.js structured project. This repository contains the source code and documentation for SCANFI.

## Features
- **Cognitive Augmentation**: Simulate and enhance PFC functions for improved cognitive tasks.
- **Multi-Agent System**: Utilize multiple specialized AI agents for different cognitive tasks.
- **Web-Based**: Built using JavaScript and deployable as a web application.
- **Scalable and Extensible**: Easily extendable to include more cognitive functions and agents.

## Getting Started
To get started with SCANFI, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iLevyTate/SCANFI.git
```

### Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd SCANFI
```

### Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## API Key Configuration
Currently, SCANFI does not use a `.env` file for configuration. To load the OpenAI API key, use the following command:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

Remember to replace `your-openai-api-key` with your actual OpenAI API key.
